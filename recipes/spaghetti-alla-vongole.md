# Spaghetti alla Vongole (Spaghetti with clam sauce)

## Ingredients

* 4 lbs. of small clams
* 2 cloves of garlic
* 1 cup of olive oil
* 1 small onion
* 1/2 cup of dry white wine
* 1 1/2 tomatoes, peeled and chopped
* Small piece of chili pepper
* 2-3 sprigs of fresh chopped parsley
* Salt and pepper
* Approximately 100 g of spaghetti per person

## Preparation

Soak the clams in salted water to draw out all the sand. Rinse them thoroughly and put them in a pan with garlic and few tablespoons of oil. Cook over moderate heat, tightly covered, until the clams open. Discard any clams that do not open. Remove them from the shells and save the remaining liquid. Heat the remaining liquid. Heat the remaining oil and saute the onion until golden. Add the wine and continue cooking until it reduces. Add the tomatoes and remaining clam juice.

Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve over spaghetti or the pasta of your choice.
