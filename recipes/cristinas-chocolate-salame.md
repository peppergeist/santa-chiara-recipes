# Cristina's Chocolate Salame

## Ingredients

* 250 g of animal crackers or other plain biscuit cookies (rice cakes can be used as well)
* 9 oz. of butter
* 250 g of Nesquik

## Preparation

Crush the cookies up, and mix together with the butter and Nesquik. If it seems to be too dry, add enough milk to allow it to roll into a log. For sweetness, add sugar to the mixture to taste.

Roll the mixture into a cylinder and wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate. It is best if refrigerated for at least 12 hours prior to serving.
