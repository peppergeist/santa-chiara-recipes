# Basic Pasta

## Ingredients

* 800 g of flour
* 200 g of fine semolino
* 8 eggs
* 2 spoonfuls of olive oil salta

## Preparation

To prepare green noodles, substitute 2 eggs with 3 spoonfuls of cooked spinach that has been well-drained and finely chopped.

Prepare a mound of flour with a depression in the middle. Place the eggs, oil, and salt in the center and begin working the ingredients together until you have a well-mixed pliable dough. Using a rolling pin, work the dough into a thin sheet. If you have a pasta machine, pass the dough through the machine several times.

Once you have a nice flat sheet of dough you can pass it back through the machine and adjust to the setting of the thickness you desire. If you don't have a machine, you can cut the pasta into strips using a hard edge. To prepare the dough for ravioli and tortellini, place the mixture evenly on the sheet of dough and cover with a second sheet of dough. Cut with a ravioli tool.
