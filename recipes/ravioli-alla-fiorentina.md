# Ravioli alla Fiorentina

## Ingredients

### Fresh green pasta

* 300 g of flour
* 100 g of semolino
* 2 eggs
* 2 spoonfuls of cooked, well-drain, and finely chopped spinach

### Filling

* 150 g of ricotta
* 300 g of raw spinach
* 1 egg
* 2 spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese
* Salt nutmeg

## Preparation

Prepare the filling by mixing the ricotta, cooked spinach, eggs, and Parmesan. Roll out the pasta and place small quantities of the filling approximately 1 cm between each one in a row. Cover with another thin sheet of pasta and pinch the edges of the pasta together.

Cut with a ravioli cutter and mold. Allow the pasta to dry before cooking. Cook in salted water, drain and cover with sauce and grated Parmesan cheese.
