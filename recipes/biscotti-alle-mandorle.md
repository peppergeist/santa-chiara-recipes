# Biscotti alle Mandorle (Florentine Almond Cookies)

## Ingredients

* 500 g flour
* 400 g sugar
* 4 eggs
* 300 g almonds
* Salt
* Grated lemon peel
* Vanilla
* Baking powder

## Preparation

Mix the sugar, eggs, almonds, vanilla, and lemon peel together and gradually begin adding the flour and baking powder. Shape the dough into a long thin log (about 7 cm wide) on a cookie sheet. Brush the surface with a well-beaten egg and cook at 400 degrees for about 7 minutes. Cut the cookies diagonally when they are still warm, and allow to cool.

The cookies can be stored for months and are traditionally served with vin santo.
