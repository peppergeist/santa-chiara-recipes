# Sugo di Pomodoro (Tomato Sauce)

## Ingredients

* Olive oil
* Onion
* Celery
* Parsley
* Basil

* Peeled tomatoes with seeds removed
* Dried peppers (optional)

## Preparation

Prepare a pan with olive oil. Chop the onion, celery, parsley, basil, and tomatoes and fry them lightly in the pan. Allow the ingredients to simmer, and stir to prevent sticking. Add salt to taste only after the sauce begins to thicken. Once it is thick, it is ready to serve. Add hot, dried peppers to taste for spice.
