# Denia's Lemon Turkey

## Ingredients

* Thinly sliced turkey breasts
* Salt and pepper
* Flour
* Olive oil
* Parsley
* 1-2 lemons
* Lemon slices

## Preparation

Salt, pepper, and flour the turkey breast. Brown in a frying pan with the olive oil. Make sure the olive oil doesn't get too hot since it burns at a lower temperature. Add the juice of one or two lemons and let it simmer until the sauce is thick. Garnish with parsley and lemon slices.
